                    <h2>Hi, I'm Emma</h2>
                    <p>I spent a decade as a professional chef, managing complexity in real time, building systems under pressure, and making things work with whatever was available. When chronic illness made that career physically unsustainable, I pivoted into data science and AI consulting.</p>

                    <p>I live with multiple invisible disabilities, including EDS, POTS, and severe food allergies. These conditions create a high "energy tax" in daily life, which means intentional planning, logistics, and contingency systems aren't optional for me. They're how I function. That lived experience shapes everything I create.</p>

                    <p>I built Realistic Resources because I was tired of advice that only works under ideal conditions. Everything here has been tested under real constraints. I don't share something unless I've used it myself and believe it can genuinely help.</p>

                    <div class="credentials">
                        <h3>What I Focus On</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Making AI and technology approachable for people who aren't technical</li>
                            <li>Tools, prompts, and frameworks that reduce confusion and decision fatigue</li>
                            <li>Navigating work and daily life with disability, realistically</li>
                            <li>Applying systems thinking from kitchens, consulting, and lived experience to everyday problems</li>
                        </ul>
