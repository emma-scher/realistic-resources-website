                    <p>And here's what I've learned: businesses optimize for what makes them money. That's not good or bad—it's just how it works.</p>
                    <p>But it means the innovation happens where the profit is. And your daily problems? Organizing paperwork, managing schedules, simplifying complicated processes—those aren't where the money is.</p>
                    <p>So the technology exists. The capability is there. It's just not being prioritized for real people solving real problems.</p>
                    <p>I could wrap those problems in a pretty AI package and sell them back to you for $50 a month. That's the standard playbook.</p>
                    <p><strong>But that's not why I'm here.</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm here to build these tools. For real.</p>

                    <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
                    <p>I spent a decade as a professional chef, managing complexity in real time, building systems under pressure, and making things work with whatever was available. When chronic illness made that career physically unsustainable, I pivoted into data science and AI consulting.</p>

                    <p>I live with multiple invisible disabilities, including EDS, POTS, and severe food allergies. These conditions mean intentional planning and contingency systems aren't optional for me—they're how I function. That lived experience shapes everything I create.</p>

                        <h3>What I Focus On</h3>

                            <li>Making AI and technology approachable for people who aren't technical</li>
                            <li>Tools that reduce confusion and decision fatigue</li>
                            <li>Navigating work and daily life with disability, realistically</li>
                            <li>Applying systems thinking from kitchens, consulting, and lived experience to everyday problems</li>
