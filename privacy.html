                </ul>

                <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.

                <h2 id="cookies">4. Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>

                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out below.</p>

                <p>We use cookies for analytics purposes to understand how visitors interact with our website. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser settings. However, if you disable cookies, some features of the Services may not function properly.</p>

                <h2 id="international">5. Is Your Information Transferred Internationally?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</em></p>

                <p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "<a href="#share">When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</a>" above), in the United States and other countries.</p>

                <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

                <p><strong>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong> We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations.</p>

                <h2 id="retention">6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h2 id="minors">7. Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>

                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:emma@realistic-resources.com">emma@realistic-resources.com</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="rights">8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

                <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.</p>

                <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.</p>

                <p>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" target="_blank">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:emma@realistic-resources.com">emma@realistic-resources.com</a>.</p>

                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

                <p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:emma@realistic-resources.com">emma@realistic-resources.com</a>. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

                <h2 id="dnt">9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2 id="california">10. Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
                <p><em>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>

                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

                <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).</p>
